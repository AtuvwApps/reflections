When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
->When working as part of a team it's important you can use a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
->You may have multiple people making changes to the remote repository and their changes may not ->cooperate with your own local version of the project, therefore it's better to pull manually so you ->know what you are pulling in as oppose to Git doing it for you without you first being able to ->examine changes. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
->Clone is a copy of a repository for you to work on, usually from GitHub to your local machine or ->just done locally. Fork is similar to clone except it is always done on GitHub and it shows where ->it has been forked from so it can be easily traced. Branches are made within a repository, usually ->made for experimental purposes when you want to try something new without having an effect on the ->master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-> It is convenient to know the last known state of the remote repository and can work offline locally.
